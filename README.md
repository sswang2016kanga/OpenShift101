# What is OpenShift?

Red Hat® OpenShift® is supported Kubernetes for cloud-native applications with enterprise security. Although Kubernetes has great scalability, workload portability and intuitive abstractions which allows you to seperate business and developer concerns, it is still quite a concern to install, deploy and keep clusters operational.

This repository contains the hands-on workshops to get started and familiar with OpenShift on IBM Cloud.
